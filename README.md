## Hi!

My name is Chris. I'm a full-stack developer branching out to platform (cloud) engineer.
I love to tinker with projects that scratch the part of my brain that ask 'could you ...' or 'would it be possible to ...'.


## NixOS

One of the fields where this question gets asked and answered again and again is on my homelab.
I build it on NixOS with the idea that my whole system is configured in code. 
Not only my server lives in that repository though, so do my desktop, laptop, steamdeck, steambox, and (at some point) phone.

## OpenStack

A question that keeps popping up in my mind is wheter it is possible to have 
the ease of a cloud (from a developer's perspective!) without being bound to Big tech.
The answer is yes. The term that describes this kind of solution is called hyperconvergant infrastructure.
OpenStack is one such solution. So I want to build a private cloud where I 
can give my friends access to my game server so that they can run some game servers.

## Streamarr

I wanted to know what it would take to build a netflix-esc UX experience on your own backend.

## Translation/localization files management tools

This is a -simple- application in order to manage localization files for a project.
I was sick and tired of plenty of apps being out there that will either lack the features I want, or are paid solutions.
So, I built it myself.

The learning goal in this project was to both learn SolidJS and the -new- File Access API.
This allows for local file editing in a web page,
this way I can offer a native experience without having to install the app (which you still can as it is a PWA)
